instalar node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)
criar um webapp (https://portal.azure.com/)

cria uma pasta local com o nome do APP e roda o express

$ npm install -g express-generator
$ express

Remove the public, routes, and view folder and create a folder in the root public-flutter which will contain the generated release build of Flutter Web from the previous step. You can find the release build in build\web .

Now replace the path from public to public-flutter in app.js and debug the node application. Youâ€™ll see the flutter web app being deployed locally.
